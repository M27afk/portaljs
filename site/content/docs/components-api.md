# Components API

You now have a basic data catalog running, the next step would be to dig into the components library. PortalJS supports the following components by default:

- `<Catalog />` A searchable catalog that will index a list of datasets and allow for contextual searching + filters.
- `<LineChart />` A simple component that allows the creation of an opinionated line chart without the need to go deep into charting standards
- `<Vega />` A wrapper around the [Vega specification](https://vega.github.io/vega/) that allows you to build pretty much any kind of chart imaginable
- `<VegaLite />` A wrapper around the [Vega Lite specification](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) which allows for a more concise grammar than Vega around the building of charts.
- `<Table />` is an easy-to-use table component with built-in pagination, search, and sorting.

For more details on those please refer to our [Storybook Documentation](https://storybook.portaljs.org/), which contains all the details on how to use them.
