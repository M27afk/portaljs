# Tutorial 1: Create a website from scratch using markdown and PortalJS

In this tutorial we will walk you through creating an elegant, fully functional website written in simple markdown and published with PortalJS.

By the end of this tutorial you will:

- have a working markdown-based website powered by PortalJS.
- be able to edit the text and add pages, all from an online interface without installing anything.

Below is a screenshot of how the final website will look like:

### Setup a sandbox website including live publishing

- Prerequisites: sign up for GitHub and Vercel
- Navigate to [datopian/flowershow repository](https://github.com/datopian/flowershow)
- Click on "Deploy"
- Let the site build on Vercel
- Visit the site! Yay! Your site is working! ðŸŽ‰

### Now, let's edit the front page

- Navigate to `content/index.md` file in the site repository
- Add some text to it
- Save and watch the site redeploy
- Visit the site! Yay! Your changes are live! ðŸŽ‰

### Let's add a page: e.g. about page

- Navigate to the `content` folder in the site repository
- Add `about.md` file with some text
- Save and watch the site redeploy
- Visit the site! Yay! Your changes are live! ðŸŽ‰

# Tutorial 2: Editing your site locally on your computer

### What is this markdown stuff?

- Idea of "markup" - how is this different from plain text
- Brief info about markdown
- Link to markdown tutorials
- Explain we offer "markdown plus"
- ?? Explain about PFM (vs GFM ...)

### Why go local?

While editing on GitHub UI is acceptable, it has its limitations â€“ it doesn't support working offline, adding multiple files simultaneously, or previewing many markdown syntax elements supported by Flowershow-based websites.
