Portal.js is an open source project that aims to simplify the creation of web-based data portals, making it easy for users to create and share data-driven applications. 

The simple-example added to Portal.js is intended to provide users with an easy way to set up a data catalog that can be used to display and share data stores stored in GitHub repositories. With this example, users can quickly set up a web-based portal that allows them to showcase their data and make it accessible to others, all this being done thru the configuration of a simple `datasets.json` file.

To get a feel of the project, users can check the [live deployment](https://example.portaljs.org).
