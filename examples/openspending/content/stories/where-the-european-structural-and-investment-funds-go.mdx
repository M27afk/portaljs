European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) is a financial instrument used by the European Union (EU) to support regional development and economic cohesion among its member states. The ESIF combines several funds to provide financial assistance to regions and cities in the EU with the aim of reducing economic disparities and promoting sustainable growth.

In this data story, our objective is to determine which country benefits the most from the ESIF funds and identify the region within the EU that receives the highest amount of funding.

To begin our analysis, we are using data on the allocation of ESIF funds across EU member states and their respective regions. These dataset are provided by previous work at OpenSpending project. See available datasets:

- Full dataset: https://www.openspending.org/@os-data/complete-european-esif-funds-beneficiaries-2007-2020
- By country, e.g., this is for Austria: https://www.openspending.org/@os-data/complete-european-esif-funds-beneficiaries-2007-2020-filtered-by-at

The data provides insights into the financial assistance provided by the European Union to support regional development and economic cohesion:
