# Installation and setup

Before installation, ensure your system satisfies the following requirements:

- Node.js 10.13 or later
- Nextjs 10.0.3
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported

> Note: We also recommend instead of npm using `yarn` instead of `npm`.
> 
Portal.js is built with React on top of Nextjs framework, so for a quick setup, you can bootstrap a  Nextjs app and install portal.js as demonstrated in the code below:

```bash=
## Create a react app
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```
After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the development server. Try editing pages/index.js and see the result on your browser.

> For more information on how to use create-next-app, you can review the [create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) documentation.

Once you have Nextjs created, you can install portal.js:

```bash=
yarn add https://github.com/datopian/portal.js.git
```

You're now ready to use portal.js in your next app. To test portal.js, open your `index.js` file in the pages folder. By default you should have some autogenerated code in the `index.js` file:


Which outputs a page with the following content:

Now, we are going to do some clean up and add a table component. In the `index.js` file, import a [Table]() component from portal as shown below:

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head'
import { Table } from 'portal' //import Table component
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

export default function Home() {

  const columns = [
    { field: 'id', headerName: 'ID' },
    { field: 'firstName', headerName: 'First name' },
    { field: 'lastName', headerName: 'Last name' },
    { field: 'age', headerName: 'Age' }
  ];

  const rows = [
    { id: 1, lastName: 'Snow', firstName: 'Jon', age: 35 },
    { id: 2, lastName: 'Lannister', firstName: 'Cersei', age: 42 },
    { id: 3, lastName: 'Lannister', firstName: 'Jaime', age: 45 },
    { id: 4, lastName: 'Stark', firstName: 'Arya', age: 16 },
    { id: 7, lastName: 'Clifford', firstName: 'Ferrara', age: 44 },
    { id: 8, lastName: 'Frances', firstName: 'Rossini', age: 36 },
    { id: 9, lastName: 'Roxie', firstName: 'Harvey', age: 65 },
  ];

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Create Portal App</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <h1 className={styles.title}>
        Welcome to <a href="https://nextjs.org">Portal.JS</a>
      </h1>

      {/* Use table component */}
      <Table data={rows} columns={columns} />

    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, your page should look like the following:
